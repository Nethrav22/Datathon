# Datathon
Hello! I competed in Stanford Health Innovations for Future Technologies (SHIFT)'s 2020 Datathon! This year's theme was Covid-19 themed, and my team was tasked with creating an innovative investigation on the factors that led to the wide-spread of the virus. Using U.S census demographic data, we plotted scatter-plots to visualize which demographics could provide insight into what factors could provide us with strong correlations relating to social distancing metrics. Specifically,  we chose to use cellphone GPS ping data. With this, we can use a combination of average time spent away from home as well as average distance away from home to create a metric for how well census groups are social distancing.
